<h1 align="center">Ruby on Rails for Nova</h1>

Provides Ruby on Rails support for Panic's Nova text editor.

> NOTICE: From `v7.0` the extension has joined the [**Nova Ruby**](https://github.com/nova-ruby) project (see below).
> That means it does not come with Solargraph and Rubocop support anymore.
> Check the new and improved [Solargraph](nova://extension/?id=com.tommasonegri.solargraph&name=Solargraph) extension for that.
>
> From now on various parts of this project, not directly related with Rails, will be extracted into dedicated extensions.
