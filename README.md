# Ruby on Rails for Nova editor

This extension is still in Alpha and various features will be added later on. If you have any suggestion or you have some free time you are free to contribute.

Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/tommasongr/nova-rails/wiki) for seeing all the available commands and features.

## NEW: Solargraph support ðŸš€

Nova Rails v1.0 ships with Solargraph support and almost all its settings exposed. You can configure it globally or on a workspace base.

> WARNING: Due to an oversight in previous versions you must have Solargraph v0.42.0 or above to access the settings.

## Features

### Rails Server Task

Automatically generate a Task for running the Rails Server command.

### Search in various documentations

Run the Search Documentation command for searching in different documentations online.

### Open the last migration or list them all

Run the Last Migration or the List Migrations commands for streamlining those operations.

### Open Alternate File

Run the Open Alternate File for rapidly switching between tests and model/controller/etc files.

### ERB Tag Switcher

Quickly switch between `<%`, `<%=` & `<%#` with a single shortcut.

Select a text to wrap it in ERB tags or just use `âŒ˜-shift->` to create a tag and start typing the expression.

### Stimulus Clips

Start typing `Stimu...` in Javascript and HTML files for inserting Stimulus completions like Controller Scaffold, actions, classes, etc. Placeholders are formatted with the correct naming conventions.

Stimulus Clips work also in Javascript and HTML derivate syntaxes like Typescript and HTML(ERB).\_
